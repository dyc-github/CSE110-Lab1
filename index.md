## About me
Hi my name is David Choi. I'm a **Computer Science** major studying at the **University of California San Diego** and previously at the **University of California Merced**.

My current research interests are in Computer Graphics, specifically **stylized shaders** and **differentiable rendering**.

```
public static void main(String args[]) {
    System.out.println("My favorite programming language is Java, even though it's trash");
}
```

Outside of Comp Sci, I enjoy playing board games, climbing, and watching competitive Valorant.  My favorite teams are:
1. DRX
2. Team Secret
3. PRX
